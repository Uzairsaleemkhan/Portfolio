I didn't know anything about coding, but I decided to follow along with a one-hour tutorial. I created a simple webpage with pictures and cool effects when you hover over them. It was confusing, but I found it interesting."

        Even though I was confused, this experience got me excited about web development. I started looking at more YouTube videos and found a ton of resources. But there were so many that I didn't know where to begin, and it felt overwhelming.

          Then I found a YouTube course called "The Complete Web Development Course" by a creator named codewithharry. At the time, I didn't know anything about programming, but I decided to give it a shot. I learned about HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. This boosted my confidence, and I made some simple web projects.

        But when I tried to build my own projects, things got tough. I couldn't solve problems and didn't understand concepts well. I started doubting if I could really do web development. It felt like maybe it wasn't meant for me.

        I didn't give up though. I took a course on Udemy about HTML and CSS by a teacher named Jonas Schmedtmann. This helped me get better at styling websites. I felt more confident in CSS, and I could make things look really good.

        content: `
        JavaScript, though, was an intricate puzzle. Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course offered insights, yet understanding remained elusive and blurry. I dabbled in basic projects but struggled to comprehend the "why" behind mastering JavaScript. Countless YouTube videos fueled my confusion, sowing seeds of doubt.

        JavaScript, however, was a different story. I tried learning from various resources, but it was hard. Then I found a YouTube channel called whatsdev, and their video "Frontend Developer Guide 2020" changed things for me. They said becoming good at frontend development takes time, at least a year. This was reassuring.

        I decided to learn more about computer science, which is the foundation of programming. I took a course called CS50 by Harvard. It covered everything from basics to algorithms, databases, and more. It was like seeing the bigger picture and understanding how things worked.

        content: `
        Then I returned to learning JavaScript. I took Jonas Schmedtmann's course again. I understood concepts like promises and async/await, but it was still blurry. I struggled with advanced topics like promises, async/await, object-oriented programming and fetching data from APIs.

        In 2022, a significant breakthrough occurred. I stumbled upon Tenzin's JavaScript course, which cost me $397. Tenzin's teaching style resonated with me, so I took the leap. The course proved invaluable, covering everything from fundamentals to advanced concepts like closures, callbacks, and asynchronous programming.
       \n
        Armed with newfound knowledge, I built projects, gaining practical experience in handling complex JavaScript tasks. The course transformed my understanding of JavaScript's inner workings and its role in web development.

        content: `
        In 2022, I explored backend development to understand how data flows between servers and the frontend. I learned about servers, databases, and how they communicate. It was confusing at first, but I found great documentation on MDN that helped me understand.

        I also delved into React, a popular frontend library. It was confusing initially, but I read the official React documentation. This clarified concepts like state and components. I learned about effects, state management, and more.
